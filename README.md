This repository contains a simple yet fully functional calculator application developed during my internship at Oasis Infobyte. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing users with basic arithmetic functionality and a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator is fully responsive and works across different device sizes.
- **Keyboard Support**: Users can interact with the calculator using both mouse and keyboard.
- **Clear Button**: A "C" button is available to clear the current input or reset the entire calculation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic and interactivity.
